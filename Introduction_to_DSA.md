## 📘 What is DSA?

* DSA stands for Data Structures and Algorithms.
1 Data Structures (DS): Organized ways to store and manage data.
2 Algorithms (A): Step-by-step methods to solve problems using data structures.

## 🎯 Why Learn DSA?
1 Helps solve problems efficiently (speed + memory).
2 Essential for coding interviews (Google, Amazon, etc.).
3 Builds strong logic and problem-solving skills.

## ⚙️ What is an Algorithm?
* An algorithm is a set of instructions to solve a problem.
Example: To search a number in a list
1 Go through each item one by one
2 Stop if you find the number

## 🧠 Time & Space Complexity
* To measure how fast and how much memory an algorithm uses:
1 Time complexity → how much time it takes (e.g., O(n), O(log n))
2 Space complexity → how much memory it uses
